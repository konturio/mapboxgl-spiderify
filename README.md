# TypeScript Library Starter

Basic setup for creating a typescript library that publishes node and browser versions.

Tested in a node.js project (node 12) and an Angular (webpack) project.

It also builds a rollup bundle for `<script>` tags

**Build**

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm pack`

Install `.tgz` file into another project.
